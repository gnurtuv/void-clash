## About The Game

Void Clash is an arcade-style space shooter where you control a lone starship against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. The game features various enemy types, power-ups to enhance your ship, and challenging boss battles. This project was developed as an exercise in vanilla JavaScript game development, focusing on modular design and core game mechanics without external libraries or game engines.
